In this 10 minute video post Cedalo's Technology Evangelist Kristian Raue demonstrates how to do time series aggregations with Streamsheets using the TABLE.UPDATE() function. 

It is also a good introductionary video about how Streamsheets work and how you can build server based apps and services in just minutes.

You will see that time based aggregations with Streamsheets are not rocket science, but actually easy to understand also for the non-programmer who uses Streamsheets.

We recommend that you watch the video in full screen mode.
