This week we had the pleasure to record a 10-minute video session with Roger Light, the project lead of the Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT project. 

We will get a simple introduction to JSON and MQTT and how these two standards work together in IoT and Stream Processing.

You will see that both technologies are not rocket science, but actually easy to understand also for the non-programmer who uses Streamsheets.

Thank you to Roger Light to make this video possible. We recommend that you watch the video in full screen mode. If you want to jump directly to the tutorial part of the video, you have to advance to minute 2:30

This session is also the first of a series of sessions where we show the basic steps towards IoT, Stream Processing, MQTT, Pub/Sub and the use of Streamsheets. So stay tuned for more!
